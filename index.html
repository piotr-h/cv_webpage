			<section>
				<p>My name is Piotr and I am working as a pharmacist. Recently however, I developed warm feelings towards new technologies and I decided to take up learning to code. Having made a thorough analysis, I chose to start with Python and I intend to study it to get a job of a back-end developer. Below you can find my cv, with a list of the showcase projects.</p>
